# Trybe Exercises

[PortuguÃªs](./README.md) | English 

Welcome! This is a personal repository in which I will register my journey into
becoming a fullstack web developer through the Trybe course. Feel free to look into it,
and to give me any tips since I'm really just beginning as of this README's writing.

I will try to document and explain everything I'm supposed to do in each exercise you see
here, but sometimes it may not be possible dur to time constraints and deadlines, but even
so I will try to come back later and add the pertinent documentation.
