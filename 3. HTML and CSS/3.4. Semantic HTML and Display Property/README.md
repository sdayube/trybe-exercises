# 3.4. Semantic HTML & Display Property
All exercise results are put in this folder as _.html_ files.

## Exercise 1: Inline Display Property

Display the list items as inline elements.

# Exercise 2: Block Display Property

Display the `<strong>` elements as block elements.

## Main exercise: Stomatopoda (Semantic HTML)

Before doing the exercises, create a _HTML_ file in the 3.4 folder and copy the code below:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!--insira os elementos aqui-->
  </body>
</html>
```

The purpose of these exercises is to put into practice what you have just learned about ** semantic HTML **.

To this end, we will create a page that features one of the most impressive animals in existence: [Stomatopoda.](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2014/07/03/natures-most-amazing-eyes-just-got-a-bit-weirder/) The styling of the page is up to you.ðŸ˜‰

For better organization, make commits to each completed task. Let's go to the exercises:

1.  Add a header on the page with the title `Soco a 80km/h: ConheÃ§a o Stomatopoda`.
    
2.  Add a set of links to represent the navigation area of the website.
    
	1.  Create a link called  `PÃ¡gina Inicial`.
	2.  Create a link called  `Sobre`.
	3.  Create a link called  `Contato`.
        
3.  Create an article that will contain the interesting facts about `Stomatopoda`. The article will be subtitled `Fatos sobre o Stomatopoda`. Here is [a great website](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/mantis_shrimp) for inspiration on which facts to add.
    
4.  Divide the article into sections, organizing it as follows:
    
    1.  A first section containing general information about the animal. The subtitle for this section is at your discretion. It is necessary to include in this section your scientific name, which is `Odontodactylus scyllarus`, in italics. In addition, there must be tabular information regarding their scientific classification, in particular:  `Reino`,  `Filo`,  `Subfilo`,  `Classe`,  `Subclasse`  e  `Ordem`. You may pick this info from [Wikipedia.](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomatopoda)
        
    2.  The other sections relate to the interesting facts you chose about the animal. For each chosen fact you will create a section.
        
    3.  Add a subtitle for each section for the chosen event.
        
    4.  Add, for each section, paragraph(s) describing the chosen fact. Highlight impressive features related to chosen fact, in order to reinforce the uniqueness of `Stomatopoda`. For instance, if you create a section detailing the animal's powerful punch, it would be interesting to highlight the speed of that punch (80km / h) in bold.
        
    5.  Add an image for each section as a way to illustrate the fact.
        
    6.  Finally, add a section of bibliographic references, containing a list of all the links that were used as a basis to compile the page in question.
        
5.  Add content adjacent to the article, providing a link to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Li1k5hGBE), that shows the animal in action.
    
6.  Add a footer to the page, showing something like "Content compiled by _".
    

_Ps:_ for this exercise, it is mandatory to use elements with **at least** the following tags: `header`, `nav`, `article`, `section`, `h1` ,`h2` ,`h3`, `aside`, `footer`, `table` and `img`.

### Validating the exercise

Now that you have created the page showing interesting facts about `Stomatopoda`, let's suppose a visually impaired person accesses your page. Will it be **_accessible_** for that person? ðŸ¤”

Let's check it out!

Enter [this site](https://achecker.ca/checker/index.php#output_div), which validates if your page is accessible or not. 

When submitting the code, you will come across validation errors present on your page, starting your second exercise: **fix all the errors pointed out**.

For each validation error shown, a link to the page with its description is available. **Before** going back to the code and fixing it, read the description of each error to **understand it** and be able to fix it.

_At the end of the exercise, in addition to having an accessible page, you will reinforce the practice of **fixing errors**, be they validation (for this exercise) or logic ones, which you will encounter throughout your career as a developer._
